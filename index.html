<h1><i>Hello from Roman Khachadoorian</i></h1>
<h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
<h3>This is my engineering website</h3>
<h4>This is where I will be doing <br> updates of my progress</b></h4>    
<h3>Week 2</h3>
<h4>Today i made a rocket in tinkerCAD September 2,2022. I did not realize at the time that we were making home appliances in tinkerCAD so i ended up making a rocket. It looks very realistic.</h4>
<h3>Week 3</h3>
<h4>September 7,2022- i finished my tinekrcad design for the Rube Goldberg machine, im confident in the design.</h4>
<h4>September 9,2022- Today we were assigned a task to create the letter E made from a piece of paper. We measured every side and cut it out.</h4>
<h4>September 14,2022- our group finished the tinkerCAD project we had chosen, i have high hopes for the design since we tested it several times and each time it did not break.</h4>
<h3>Week 4</h3>
<h4>September 16,2022- i made a paper boat that floated for almost two minutes, the boat had 80g of weights in it. The problem was that the walls were not strong enough and eventually collapsed. Our group boat did not last very long, it sank as soon as we put it in since the sides were not tall enough to keep water out.</h4>
<h3>Week 5</h3>
<h4>September 21,2022- The Rube Goldberg project our group designed successfully popped the balloon on the first attempt. A pulley with a basket attached to it used a baseball to weigh down one side so the othe side jumps up. We put a spike on one end which would come up and pop the balloon.</h4>    
<h3>Week 6</h3>
<h4>September 28,2022- Our group dissected a computer and labeled each part with colored pencils. Some parts were difficult to identify since the computer was old.</h4>
<h3>Week 7</h3>
<h4>October 5,2022- My job was to design an animal prosthetic and i think i did a good job of it. I designed a prosthetic eagle beak that is 3d printed and made of a plastic polymer.</h4>
<h4>October 7,2022- I created very specific instructions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I also watched someone make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich using instructions from the class.</h4>
<h3> Week 8</h3>
<h4>October 11,2022- We designed bottle rockets that would fly sideways and created a BOM(Bill of Materials) that lists everything we used in the rocket building. We created the rocket designs on tinkerCAD and that will be built with cardboard.</h4>
<h3>Week 9</h3>
<h4>October 13,2022- Flying paper challenge. We made paper airplanes and the challenge was to land one in a bucket. No one could land it in the bucket but some got real close, mine overshot the bucket by a long shot.</h4>
<h3>Week 10</h3>
<h4>October 15,2022- Today we went outside and created DIY water filters inside of 2L coke bottles using big rocks, small rocks, sand, and cotton. We arranged the materials in such a way that it would filter the water as it poured down the coke bottle.</h4>
<h3>Week 11</h3>
<h4>November 1, 2022- Our class studied Ohm's law and how voltage, resistance, and current work in circuits. We did some math too with resistance and voltage calculations.</h4>
<h4>November 4, 2022- We created circuit boards in tinkerCAD designing series and parallel circuits of LED lights.</h4>
<h3>Week 12</h3>
<h4>November 8,2022- I practiced using a multimeter and designing an actual circuit board using an arduino that we connected to our chromebook. We experimented with the circuit design until it worked.</h4>
