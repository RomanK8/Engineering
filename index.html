<h1><i>Hello from Roman Khachadoorian</i></h1>
<h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
<h3>This is my engineering website</h3>
<h4>This is where I will be doing <br> updates of my progress</b></h4>    
<h3>Week 2</h3>
<h4>Today i made a rocket in tinkerCAD September 2,2022. I did not realize at the time that we were making home appliances in tinkerCAD so i ended up making a rocket. It looks very realistic.</h4>
<h3>Week 3</h3>
<h4>September 7,2022- i finished my tinekrcad design for the Rube Goldberg machine, im confident in the design.</h4>
<h4>September 9,2022- Today we were assigned a task to create the letter E made from a piece of paper. We measured every side and cut it out.</h4>
<h4>September 14,2022- our group finished the tinkerCAD project we had chosen, i have high hopes for the design since we tested it several times and each time it did not break.</h4>
<h3>Week 4</h3>
<h4>September 16,2022- i made a paper boat that floated for almost two minutes, the boat had 80g of weights in it. The problem was that the walls were not strong enough and eventually collapsed. Our group boat did not last very long, it sank as soon as we put it in since the sides were not tall enough to keep water out.</h4>
<h3>Week 5</h3>
<h4>September 21,2022- The Rube Goldberg project our group designed successfully popped the balloon on the first attempt. A pulley with a basket attached to it used a baseball to weigh down one side so the othe side jumps up. We put a spike on one end which would come up and pop the balloon.</h4>    
<h3>Week 6</h3>
<h4>September 28,2022- Our group dissected a computer and labeled each part with colored pencils. Some parts were difficult to identify since the computer was old.</h4>
<h3>Week 7</h3>
<h4>October 5,2022- My job was to design an animal prosthetic and i think i did a good job of it. I designed a prosthetic eagle beak that is 3d printed and made of a plastic polymer.</h4>
<h4>October 7,2022- I created very specific instructions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I also watched someone make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich using instructions from the class.</h4>
<h3> Week 8</h3>
<h4>October 11,2022- We designed bottle rockets that would fly sideways and created a BOM(Bill of Materials) that lists everything we used in the rocket building. We created the rocket designs on tinkerCAD and that will be built with cardboard.</h4>
<h3>Week 9</h3>
<h4>October 13,2022- Flying paper challenge. We made paper airplanes and the challenge was to land one in a bucket. No one could land it in the bucket but some got real close, mine overshot the bucket by a long shot.</h4>
<h3>Week 10</h3>
<h4>October 15,2022- Today we went outside and created DIY water filters inside of 2L coke bottles using big rocks, small rocks, sand, and cotton. We arranged the materials in such a way that it would filter the water as it poured down the coke bottle.</h4>
<h3>Week 11</h3>
<h4>November 1, 2022- Our class studied Ohm's law and how voltage, resistance, and current work in circuits. We did some math too with resistance and voltage calculations.</h4>
<h4>November 4, 2022- We created circuit boards in tinkerCAD designing series and parallel circuits of LED lights.</h4>
<h3>Week 12</h3>
<h4>November 8,2022- I practiced using a multimeter and designing an actual circuit board using an arduino that we connected to our chromebook. We experimented with the circuit design until it worked.</h4>
<h3>S2 Week 1</h3>
<h4>This week Christian and I created a shark tank presentation for an app that allowed you to virtually try on clothes before buying them. We asked for $500,000 for a 20% stake in the company and answered some questions.</h4>
<h3>S2 Week 2</h3>
<h4> This week was chemical engineering week and we were tasked with finding a solution to a problem which involved a reserrvoir being contaminated if it was exposed to sunlight. The solution was to use little black rubber balls to block the sun, this option was cost effective and solved the problem.</h4>
<h3>S2 Week 3</h3>
<h4>Today we start our engineering project and we can choose between a mechanical, electrical, or civil engineering project. I choose the electrical engineering project in my proposal which was a RC car we have to make from scratch.</h4>
<h3>S2 Week 4</h3>
<h4>We continue the engineering project by creating a tinkerCAD of what we are going to make. I made a RC car that has 4 wheels powered by motors and remotely controlled with a bluetooth module.</h4>
<h3>Project 1</h3>
<h4>During the building of the arduino RC car our first problem was connecting pieces on the breadboard. We looked up tutorials and had partial success. We eventually asked Mr.Kim how to do the wiring and he helped us with the breadboard.</h4>
<h4>As for the body of the car, Christian worked on that while i did the wiring and he built a 5"by 8" cardboard body to place the parts on. We had to make two cardboard wheels since we were not provided with two extra motors or wheels.</h4>
<h4>Our final struggle was coding the arduino to remotely control the car.  The problem with this is that it relies on a bluetooth module to control the car but there were no apps on the app store to do this so we did not know what to do. Christian came up with a solution by coding it so the car repeats a very long loop that makes it seem its moving on its own.</h4>
<h3>S2 Week 10</h3>
<h4>On week 10 of semester 2 we created sketches of a container that would hold an egg and protect it from a two story fall. We also grouped up and chose a sketch to create. We designed the chosen sketch on tinkerCAD.</h4>
<h3>S2 Week 11</h3>
<h4>This week our group started building the device that would hold the egg and eventually created it. The container is a small cardboard box that is held by straws and pencils which are connected to a garbage bag which acts as a parachute. We tested the design and the egg did not crack.</h4>
<h3>S2 Week 12</h3>
<h4>On week 12 we started a cardboat boat project. During this project we will create and test a cardboard boat with the objective of being able to hold two people in one boat without sinking and making it to the other side of the pool without sinking.</h4>
<h4>We each created a sketch of what our boat would look like with measurements and grouped up together. Each group chose a sketch and started designing a tinkerCAD of it. Once the tinkerCADs were approved we started building the boats and we continue to do so. Currently our boat is in construction and progress is going well.</h4>
