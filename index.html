<h1><i>Hello from Roman Khachadoorian</i></h1>
<h2>Welcome to my website</h2>
<h3>This is my engineering website</h3>
<h4>This is where I will be doing <br> updates of my progress</b></h4>    
<h4>Today i made a rocket in tinkerCAD September 2,2022. I did not realize at the time that we were making home appliances in tinkerCAD so i ended up making a rocket. It looks very realistic.</h4>
<h4>September 7,2022- i finished my tinekrcad design for the Rube Goldberg machine, im confident in the design.</h4>
<h4>September 14,2022- our group finished the tinkerCAD project we had chosen, i have high hopes for the design since we tested it several times and each time it did not break.</h4>
<h4>September 16,2022- i made a paper boat that floated for almost two minutes, the boat had 80g of weights in it. The problem was that the walls were not strong enough and eventually collapsed. Our group boat did not last very long, it sank as soon as we put it in since the sides were not tall enough to keep water out.</h4>
<h4>September 21,2022- The Rube Goldberg project our group designed successfully popped the balloon on the first attempt. A pulley with a basket attached to it used a baseball to weigh down one side so the othe side jumps up. We put a spike on one end which would come up and pop the balloon.</h4>
